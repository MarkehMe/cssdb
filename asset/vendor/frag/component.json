  "readme": "\nFrag\n====\n\nFrag is a fluid, responsive, simple grid system for CSS written in Sass.\n\n**Current Version:** *2.1.0*  \n**Full Support:** *Android Browser 2.2–4.2, Firefox 3.6, Firefox 4–19, Google Chrome 14–25, Internet Explorer 8–10, Mobile Safari iOS 3–6, Opera 12.10, Safari 5–6*  \n**Degraded Support:** *Internet Explorer 6–7 (fixed width grid and lose a little functionality, but content is still presentable)*\n\n![Frag][logo]\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nFrag is easy to use and highly configurable, you can use it with either plain CSS or Sass. The [Frag website][frag] has the full documentation.\n\n* [Installing and using Frag][frag-install]\n* [Configuring Frag, and customising to suit your needs][frag-config]\n* [Grid usage documentation][frag-docs]\n* [Frag grid demo][frag-demo]\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nIn order to build CSS from the Frag source files, you'll need to install the [Sass command line utility][sass]. If you're on Windows, you'll need to install [Make][make].\n\nOnce you're set up, you can run the following commands:\n\n```sh\n$ make compile # compile Sass source to CSS\n$ make minify # compile Sass source to CSS and minify\n```\n\nWhen no build target is specified, make will run minify and compile. This means you can use the following command for brevity:\n\n```sh\n$ make\n```\n\nWork on files in the `lib` directory; files in `build` are generated by the build tools. Please run `make` and commit generated files before opening a pull request.\n\n\nLegacy\n------\n\nFrag 1.0 supported LESS as well as Sass, and handled things a little differently. The [Frag 1.0 source is still available here][1x].\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright 2013, Rowan Manning  \nLicensed under the [MIT][mit] license.\n\n\n\n[1x]: https://github.com/rowanmanning/frag/tree/1.x\n[frag]: http://fragcss.com/\n[frag-install]: http://fragcss.com/docs/install/\n[frag-config]: http://fragcss.com/docs/config/\n[frag-docs]: http://fragcss.com/docs/\n[frag-demo]: http://fragcss.com/demo/\n[logo]: http://fragcss.com/media/logo.png\n[make]: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm\n[mit]: http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\n[sass]: http://sass-lang.com/download.html\n",
