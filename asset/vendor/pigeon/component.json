  "readme": "\nPigeon\n======\n\nPigeon is an OOCSS framework for rapid prototyping and building smart, scalable websites.\n\n**Current Version:** *1.1.1*  \n**Browser Support:** *Android Browser 2.2–4.2, Firefox 3.6, Firefox 4–16, Google Chrome 14–23, Internet Explorer 7–10, Mobile Safari iOS 4–6, Opera 12.10, Safari 5–6*\n\n![Pigeon][logo]\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nPigeon is easy to use and highly configurable, you can use it with either plain CSS or Sass. The [Pigeon website][pigeon] has the full documentation.\n\n* [Installing and using Pigeon][pigeon-install]\n* [Configuring Pigeon, and customising to suit your needs][pigeon-config]\n* [Full API documentation on all of Pigeon's OOCSS objects][pigeon-objects]\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nIn order to build CSS from the Pigeon source files, you'll need to install the [Sass command line utility][sass]. If you're on Windows, you'll also need to install [Make for Windows][make].\n\nOnce you're set up, you can run the following commands:\n\n```sh\n$ make compile # compile Sass source to CSS\n$ make minify # compile Sass source to CSS and minify\n```\n\nWhen no build target is specified, make will run minify and compile. This means you can use the following command for brevity:\n\n```sh\n$ make\n```\n\nWork on files in the `lib` directory; files in `build` are generated by the build tools. Please run `make` and commit generated files before opening a pull request.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright 2013, Rowan Manning  \nLicensed under the [MIT][mit] license.\n\n\n\n[logo]: http://pigeoncss.com/media/logo.png\n[make]: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm\n[mit]: http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\n[pigeon]: http://pigeoncss.com/\n[pigeon-install]: http://pigeoncss.com/docs/install/\n[pigeon-config]: http://pigeoncss.com/docs/config/\n[pigeon-objects]: http://pigeoncss.com/docs/objects/\n[sass]: http://sass-lang.com/download.html\n",
