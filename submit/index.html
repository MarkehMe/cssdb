<h1 class="h2">Submit A CSS Library</h1>

<p>
    We're more than happy to look over your CSS, Sass, LESS and Stylus libraries
    and add them to CSSDB. We have a manual
    <a href="/vetting/">vetting process</a> in place, so please be patient.
</p>

<p>
    Submissions should be opened as pull requests on the
    <a href="https://github.com/rowanmanning/cssdb">CSSDB repository</a>.
    Instructions can be found in the README file.
