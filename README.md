Development
-----------

Feel free to contribute code, design and ideas to CSSDB, we'll be more than happy to chat with you. Please, before diving in, review our [contribution guidelines][contributing]. This will help prevent you and me both from wasting time :)

All code should be linted and have passing tests. You can run JSHint with the correct config, and run feature tests using the commands below:

```sh
$ make lint  # Lint JavaScript code
$ make test  # Run automated tests
```
