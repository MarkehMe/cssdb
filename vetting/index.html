title: Submission Vetting Process
---

<h1 class="h2">Submission Vetting Process</h1>

<p>
    We use a manual vetting process for all submitted libraries. It can take anywhere between 10
    minutes and a week to look over your library (this normally directly correlates to whether I'm
    at work or enjoying a beer somewhere).
</p>

<p>
    I don't have the time to communicate directly with each submitter, but if you're concerned that
    I may not have looked at your library after a week's gone past then you can
    <a href="http://twitter.com/rowanmanning">tweet me and ask</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In the interest of transparency, the rules below are what I use to decide whether a library gets
    added. If the answer to any one of these questions is "no", then I don't add the library.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Is the library focused on CSS or a preprocessor? (Some complementary JavaScript is OK,
        but the core library should work with CSS or a preprocessor <em>only</em>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Has the library been touched in the last three years?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the library have a README <em>or</em> maintained website?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is the library original (not copyright infringing or a fork of a more popular repo)?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is the library inoffensive/SFW?
    </li>
    <li>
        Is the library/documentation written in English? (Sorry, the site currently targets
        English speakers. There's definitely scope in future to open-source this site and
        endorse other language versions of CSSDB)
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    As well as the above, I still maintain veto rights. I'll add to the list above if I need to.
</p>

<p>
    OK with all that? Go ahead and <a href="/submit/">submit your library</a>!
</p>
